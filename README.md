## Fixed Bug
### The Situation:
When a user deletes their profile, all threads, comments and votes the user has made on the platform should get deleted with it. 
The current set up is as followed:

```

class Thread(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200, unique=True)
    slug = models.SlugField(max_length=200, unique=True)
    author = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL,
        on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="posts")
    content = models.TextField()
    votes = models.IntegerField(default=0)
    created_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    status = models.IntegerField(choices=STATUS, default=0)
    tags = TaggableManager()

    class Meta:
        ordering = ["-created_on"]

    def __str__(self):
        return f"The title of this thread is {self.title}"

    # Creating the slug
    def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if not self.slug:
            self.slug = slugify(self.title)
        super().save(*args, **kwargs)

    def up_vote(self, user):
        # Check if the user has already voted for the thread
        if not self.thread_votes.filter(user=user).exists():
            self.votes = F('votes') + 1
            self.save()
            self.thread_votes.create(user=user, value=1)
        elif self.thread_votes.get(user=user, thread_id=self.id).value == -1:
            self.votes = F('votes') + 2
            self.save()
            vote = self.thread_votes.get(user=user, thread_id=self.id)
            vote.value = 1
            vote.save()
        # Here need to come an exception that gets handle to inform the user that they have already voted.

    def down_vote(self, user):
        # Check if the user has already voted for the thread
        if not self.thread_votes.filter(user=user).exists():
            self.votes = F('votes') - 1
            self.save()
            self.thread_votes.create(user=user, value=-1)
        elif self.thread_votes.get(user=user, thread_id=self.id).value == 1:
            self.votes = F('votes') - 2
            self.save()
            vote = self.thread_votes.get(user=user, thread_id=self.id)
            vote.value = -1
            vote.save()

class ThreadVote(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    created_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    value = models.SmallIntegerField()
    thread = models.ForeignKey(Thread, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="thread_votes")

```

### The Problem:
After Deleting a User, their votes (as instances of the Vote Model) get deleted, but the value "votes" of the Thread itselfs is never. Since the Votes for each thread is are the Thread.values that get displayed. The Votes in the website are never updated.

### Possible solutions:
The idea is to write a function for the ThreadVote Model that adjusts the value of the belonging thread, everytime one ThreadVote gets deleted.

I tried this by overwriting the delete() function.

```

class ThreadVote(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    created_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    value = models.SmallIntegerField()
    thread = models.ForeignKey(Thread, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="thread_votes")

    def delete(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # Update the thread's vote count before deleting the vote instance
        if self.value == 1:
            self.thread.votes = F('votes') - 1
        elif self.value == -1:
            self.thread.votes = F('votes') + 1

        self.thread.save()
        super().delete(*args, **kwargs)

```

This wasn't working, because as it turns out, this isn't working for results of a cascading delete and therefore not a solution for my problem. The Django Docs suggest to use pre_delete, which works perfectly and solved the problem:

```

@receiver(pre_delete, sender=ThreadVote)
def update_thread_votes(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    if instance.value == 1:
        instance.thread.votes = F('votes') - 1
    elif instance.value == -1:
        instance.thread.votes = F('votes') + 1
    instance.thread.save()

```
