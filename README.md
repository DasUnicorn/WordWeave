# Weaver

Weaver is Reddit style news site. Users can create Threads on diverse topics and sparking discussions. Each Thread functions as a dynamic structure where users can share insights, opinions, and reactions through comments. With the ability to upvote/downvote Threads and comments, users actively shape the narrative and show their support or dislike.

Behind the scenes, Weaver is powered by Python, using a Django web framework. The user interface is crafted using Boostrap CSS and JavaScript. Furthermore, Weaver is deployed on Heroku, a cloud platform as a service (PaaS).

## User Experience

### Target Audience

The target audience for Weaver includes creators, enthusiasts, and curious minds with a focus on engaging young and hip generations through its modern and vibrant design. These individuals are passionate about engaging in conversations on the platform or sharing ideas in the comment section. 

### User stories
Features in this project are structured through [user stories](https://github.com/DasUnicorn/WordWeave/issues?q=is%3Aissue).
Each User Story contains:
- **Dependencies:** This field indicates any external factors or requirements that need to be fulfilled before the user story can be implemented in a form of a list of other user stories.
- **Description Of Service Or Screen:** This field typically describes the specific service, feature, or screen that the user story relates to.
- **User Objective:** This field outlines the user's goal or objective. It should clearly state what the user wants to achieve or accomplish. The format follows: "As a user, I want to [action], so that [reason or benefit]."
- **Acceptance Criteria:** This field specifies the conditions or criteria that must be met for the user story to be considered complete. It helps define the boundaries and expectations for implementing the user story.

#### Workflow
In the development process, a Kanban board in form of a [github project](https://github.com/users/DasUnicorn/projects/2) is used to manage the tasks and track their progress. Initially, all issues are collected and placed in the backlog. During each iteration, a set number of issues are selected to be developed and assigned to the current milestone. These selected issues are then moved to the 'To Do' column on the Kanban board, indicating that they are ready to be worked on.

When working on the tasks begins, the status of the issues is updated to 'In Process'. This signifies that active development is underway. Once the development work is completed, the issues move to the 'Testing' column, where they undergo thorough testing to ensure the acceptions criterias are met.

If an issue passes testing successfully, it is considered 'Done' and is moved to the final column on the Kanban board.

If an issue encounters blockers or dependencies that prevent progress, it is moved to the 'Waiting' column. Here, it remains until the blockers are resolved, allowing work to resume.

Throughout its journey, from 'To Do' to 'Testing' and ultimately 'Done', detailed information including comments, Git commits, and testing results is added to each issue. This approach ensures transparency regarding the path and work undertaken for every issue.

## Design
The design process began with the creation of [three concepts:](https://www.figma.com/file/kyb4eClnCRghZT5nCFtHZ7/Untitled?type=whiteboard&node-id=0%3A1&t=HesaSLC53DPFYpXK-1) a retro-inspired theme featuring nostalgic colors and forms, a modern and elegant approach with sleek lines and refined aesthetics, and a hip neon profile.

These concepts were presented to other people for feedback and evaluation. Their insights and preferences were carefully considered to for each design. After thorough deliberation, the trendy cool neon design was the favored choice. Its vibrant colors, dynamic elements, and modern flair resonated most strongly with the audience.

#### Cascading Deletes for Votes
##### The Situation:
When a user deletes their profile, all threads, comments and votes the user has made on the platform should get deleted with it. 
The current set up is as followed:

```

class Thread(models.Model):
    (...)

    def up_vote(self, user):
        # Check if the user has already voted for the thread
        if not self.thread_votes.filter(user=user).exists():
            self.votes = F('votes') + 1
            self.save()
            self.thread_votes.create(user=user, value=1)
        elif self.thread_votes.get(user=user, thread_id=self.id).value == -1:
            self.votes = F('votes') + 2
            self.save()
            vote = self.thread_votes.get(user=user, thread_id=self.id)
            vote.value = 1
            vote.save()
        # Here need to come an exception that gets handle to inform the user that they have already voted.

    def down_vote(self, user):
        # Check if the user has already voted for the thread
        if not self.thread_votes.filter(user=user).exists():
            self.votes = F('votes') - 1
            self.save()
            self.thread_votes.create(user=user, value=-1)
        elif self.thread_votes.get(user=user, thread_id=self.id).value == 1:
            self.votes = F('votes') - 2
            self.save()
            vote = self.thread_votes.get(user=user, thread_id=self.id)
            vote.value = -1
            vote.save()

class ThreadVote(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    created_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    value = models.SmallIntegerField()
    thread = models.ForeignKey(Thread, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="thread_votes")

```

##### The Problem:
After Deleting a User, their votes (as instances of the Vote Model) get deleted, but the value "votes" of the Thread itselfs is never. Since the Votes for each thread is are the Thread.values that get displayed. The Votes in the website are never updated.

##### The Solution:
The goal is to create a function within the ThreadVote Model that updates the value of the associated thread whenever a ThreadVote is deleted.

I tried this by overwriting the delete() function.

```
class ThreadVote(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    created_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    value = models.SmallIntegerField()
    thread = models.ForeignKey(Thread, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="thread_votes")

    def delete(self, *args, **kwargs):
        # Update the thread's vote count before deleting the vote instance
        if self.value == 1:
            self.thread.votes = F('votes') - 1
        elif self.value == -1:
            self.thread.votes = F('votes') + 1

        self.thread.save()
        super().delete(*args, **kwargs)
```

The issue arose because, contrary to expectations, an overwritten delete function is not utilized for cascading deletes. Following the recommendation in the Django Docs to use pre_delete resolved the issue effectively.

```
@receiver(pre_delete, sender=ThreadVote)
def update_thread_votes(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    if instance.value == 1:
        instance.thread.votes = F('votes') - 1
    elif instance.value == -1:
        instance.thread.votes = F('votes') + 1
    instance.thread.save()
```
#### Default Pictures get deleted
##### The Situation:
After signing up the user recieves a default profile picture.
The moment any user changes their profile picture, it is gone for everyone.

##### The Problem:
With the storage of pictures in the cloud bucket, it was implemented that the old picture was deleted the moment one of the users deletes their profile picture by chooseing a new one, the default image gets deleted from the bucket.

##### The Solution:
To solve this problem the default picture was removed as a concept from the model and instead implemented in form of a fallback inside the template itself.
The default profile picture is now safely stored inside the static files and can not be deleted by users.

**Before:**
```
<div class="pt-5 d-flex md-rows align-items-center w-100 max-w-75">
    <img src="{{ user.profile_pic.url }}" alt="Profile Picture" class="profile-pic bg-light rounded-circle">
    <div class="bg-light text-dark w-75 p-2 m-3 text-center">
        <h1>{{ user.username }}</h1>
        <p>{{ user.bio }}</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

**After:**
```
<div class="pt-5 d-flex md-rows align-items-center w-100 max-w-75">
    {% if user.profile_pic %}
    <img src="{{ user.profile_pic.url }}" alt="Profile Picture" class="profile-pic bg-light rounded-circle">
    {% else %}
    <img src="{% static 'img/default.png' %}" alt="Profile Picture" class="profile-pic bg-light rounded-circle">
    {% endif %}
    <div class="bg-light text-dark w-75 p-2 m-3 text-center">
        <h1>{{ user.username }}</h1>
        <p>{{ user.bio }}</p>
    </div>
</div>
```
